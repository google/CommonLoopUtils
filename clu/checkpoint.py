"""Simple checkpointing library for TF2/Flax.

The class `Checkpoint` is a simple wrapper around `tf.train.Checkpoint` that
also stores a `flax.struct.dataclass` instance in the same directory.

Synopsis:

  from clu import checkpoint
  import flax

  @flax.struct.dataclass
  class TrainState:
    optimizer: flax.optim.Optimizer
    step: int

  ds = load_tf_dataset()
  ds_iter = iter(ds)
  ckpt = checkpoint.MultihostCheckpoint(base_directory, dict(ds_iter=ds_iter))
  optimizer = create_flax_optimizer()
  state = TrainState(optimizer=optimizer, step=0)
  state = ckpt.restore_or_initialize(state)  # Also restores `ds_iter`.
  initial_step = int(state.step) + 1
  # Need to replicate all data when training with multiple accelerators.
  state = flax.jax_utils.replicate(state)

  for step in range(initial_step, steps + 1):
    state = update_step(state, next(ds_iter))
    ckpt.save(flax.jax_utils.unreplicate(state))

Loading the model e.g. in a Colab:

  from clu import checkpoint
  import flax
  from . import mnist_lib

  state_dict = checkpoint.load_state_dict(base_directory)
  params = state_dict['optimizer']['target']['params']
  module = mnist_lib.MyArchitecture.partial(num_classes=10)
  model = flax.deprecated.nn.Model(module, params)
