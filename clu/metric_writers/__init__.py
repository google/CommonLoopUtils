"""Metric writers write ML model outputs during model training and evaluation.

This module introduces the MetricWriter interface. MetricWriters allow users
to write out metrics about ML models during training and evaluation (e.g. loss,
accuracy).
There is a MetricWriter implementation for each back end (e.g. TensorFlow
summaries) and classes that work on top other MetricWriter to
write to multiple writes at once or write asynchronously.

Note: The current interface might not contain write() methods for all possible
data types. We are open for extending the interface to other data types
(e.g. audio).

Usage:
  writer = MyMetricWriterImplementation()
  # Before training.
  writer.write_hparams({"learning_rate": 0.001, "batch_size": 64})
  # Start training loop.
  for step in range(num_train_steps):
    loss = train_step()
    if step % 50 == 0:
      writer.write_scalars(step, {"loss": loss})
      accuracy = evaluate()
      writer.write_scalars(step, {"accuracy": accuracy})
  # Make sure all values were written.
  writer.flush()  # or use metric_writers.ensure_flushes() context.
